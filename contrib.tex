\section{Criteria for cryptographic elliptic curves}
\label{s:criteria}

%<<<2
We give here a list of useful criteria for selecting elliptic curves
for general cryptographic use.
We sort these conditions in several categories,
with different importance being granted to each category.
The first category~(\ref{ss:dlp}) contains the minimal conditions under which
the discrete logarithm problem may be hard in the point group.
The second category~(\ref{ss:side}) describes some properties that improve
the resistance of the curve to some common side-channel attacks.
The third one~(\ref{ss:normal}) is not related to any known attack;
instead, it gives condition under which a curve may be considered
as particular and therefore maybe particularly vulnerable
to some yet-unknown attack.
Finally, the last two categories group some properties
which may be desirable about the curve,
either for facilitating its implementation~(\ref{ss:convenience})
or for specific protocols and algorithms~(\ref{ss:particular}),
without weakening too much its security.

\bigbreak

%<<<2
We point out that several of these conditions are in contradiction
with each other.

\paragraph{Choice of the cardinality of the base field
and the curve coefficients.}
These may either be chosen pseudo-randomly,
as a precaution against some side-channel attacks~(\ref{sss:special-side})
or against some possible future attacks~(\ref{sss:special-anormal});
or very small values may be chosen instead,
in the view of faster curve arithmetic~(\ref{sss:special-fast}).

\paragraph{Cofactor.}
While the existence of a very small torsion subgroup
may lead to some attacks such as
small-subgroup attack or side-channel attacks~(\ref{sss:special-points}),
it is a necessary condition for the availability
of some faster curve coordinates
such as Edwards or Montgomery curves~(\ref{sss:other-eq}).

\paragraph{Primality of the order of the quadratic twist.}
In general, we expect that the order of the quadratic twist
will have at least one large prime divisor,
for example larger than~$p^{1/4}$ (\ref{sss:normal-twist}).
If this order is itself a prime number,
then this grants a supplementary layer of protection
against some side-channel attacks (\ref{sss:twist}).
However, this property is relatively rare itself
(by a linear factor in~$\log p$),
which could raise concern that
curves with a prime twist are themselves exceptional in some way.

Because of all these contradictory conditions,
we think that several curves and curve families should be used,
so that each implementation might select the appropriate curve
depending on the context,
such as performance constraints or the likelihood of side-channel attacks.

\paragraph{Prime fields.}%<<<2
We limit our discussion to elliptic curves defined over a prime field.
In the case of extension fields,
some attacks exist in particular
cases~\cite{jc2013jv,rsa2004mtw,asia1999dgm,jc2002ghs}.
Some of these attack may even be exploited
do include a trapdoor in an elliptic curve~\cite{jc2006teske}.
We also note that, over finite fields with small characteristic,
an index calculus technique related to that of~\cite{jc2013jv}
gives a quasi-polynomial solution to
the multiplicative discrete logarithm problem~\cite{euro2014bgjt}.
For all these reasons, we consider elliptic curves over prime fields
as probably much safer than elliptic curves over extension fields.


\subsection*{Notations}
In all the remainder of this section,
we shall use the following notations:
$p ≥ 5$~is a prime number,
$k = \F_{p}$ is the finite field with $p$~elements,
$E: y^2 = x^3 + a\,x + b$~is an elliptic curve defined over~$k$,
$N = \abs{E(\F_p)}$~is the order of the group of rational points of~$E$,
$t = p + 1 - N$~is the trace of the Frobenius automorphism of~$E$,
and $q$~is the largest prime divisor of~$N$.

%>>>2
\subsection{Hardness of the discrete logarithm problem}
\label{ss:dlp}

We give here a list of conditions corresponding to
known attacks on the discrete logarithm problems.
We point out that some criteria commonly required
for generating elliptic curves,
such as the criteria on the discriminant and class number~\cite{rfc5639},
are not known to lead to a direct attack.
Therefore, we do not include them here.
Nonetheless, a randomly chosen curve will satisfy the
criteria usually edicted for these values with overwhelming probability.
That is, a “normal” curve in the sense of Section~\ref{ss:normal}
will satisfy such criteria and will not be affected by yet-unknown
attacks relying on these values being exceptionnally small.
To conclude, the omission of these criteria here is not problematic.

\subsubsection{Nonsingular curve}

If the discriminant~$4\, a^3 + 27\,b^2$
of the curve~$E$ is zero, then $E$~is not an elliptic curve:
it is a singular curve and its group of points is isomorphic to
an additive or multiplicative group.
Such (non-elliptic) curves must be excluded.

\subsubsection{Large prime subgroup}

Since discrete logarithms are computable in the group~$E(k)$
with complexity~$O(√q)$, where $q$~is the largest prime divisor of~$N$,
it is necessary that~$√q$ attains the required security bound.
In practice, it is advisable to select elliptic curves whose order~$N$
is the product of a large prime~$q$
and a very small \emph{cofactor}~$N/q$.
A cofactor $1$ yields an optimal security for a given bitsize
whereas a very small cofactor might allow performance improvements.

For a given curve~$E$, checking if this is the case
requires computing the group order~$N$,
which is a moderately expensive task.
For curves over large prime field, the most efficient algorithms are variations
of the SEA algorithm~\cite{mathcomp1985schoof,
jtnb1995schoof,smf2008cl} with complexity~$O(\log(q)^4)$.

The probability that a random elliptic curve over~$\F_p$
has a prime group order is bounded below~\cite{lms2000gm}
by $\frac{0.44}{\log p}$.
This condition is the most restrictive in practical use.

\subsubsection{Absence of additive transfer}

If $N = p$ then there exists an \emph{additive transfer}
reducing the discrete logarithm in~$E(k)$
to that in the additive group of~$\F_p$.
Therefore, elliptic curves with trace~$1$ must be excluded.

\subsubsection{Absence of multiplicative transfer}
\label{sss:embedding-degree}

The \emph{embedding degree} is the smallest integer~$e$ such that
$q$~divides~$p^e -1$.
The pairing attached to the elliptic curve~$E$
gives a group homorphism from~$E(k)$
to the multiplicative group~$\F_{p^e}^{×}$.

Therefore, elliptic curves with an embedding degree small enough
that discrete logarithms are computable in $\F_{p^e}^{×}$
must be excluded.

Over the base field~$\F_p$, the supersingular curves
are exactly the curves with trace zero.
They have an embedding degree~one and must be excluded.

\subsubsection{Index calculus}

Index calculus used to compute discrete logarithms in multiplicative subgroups
of finite fields has been extended to elliptic curves in a variety of ways.
However, in the current state of art, it is more expensive
to correctly lift the curve and the points defining the DLP than
to directly solve it~\cite{asia1998ss,dcc2000silverman,dcc2000ksst,ecc2007silverman,sac2008silverman},
so that such algorithms are not to be considered yet.

\subsection{Resistance to common side-channel attacks}
\label{ss:side}

While the existence of side-channel attacks
mainly depends upon the implementation of the curve,
in some circumstances the choice of the curve itself
might have an impact on the effiency of these attacks
or on the ease of implementation of appropriate counter-measures.

\subsubsection{Twist security}
\label{sss:twist}

The \emph{quadratic twist} of the elliptic curve~$E$
is the curve~$E'$ with equation~$d y^2 = x^3 + a\,x + b$,
where $d$~is a non-square element of~$k$.
For a given abscissa~$x_0$,
exactly one of the curves~$E, E'$ contains a point~$(x_0, y)$.

An attacker may manipulate a badly written implementation
into using the quadratic twist~$E'$
in place of the original curve~$E$,
either through side-channel attacks~\cite{fdtc2008flrv},
or through attacks on a badly designed protocol.

Such attacks may be easily mitigated by checking
that the manipulated points are on the original curve~$E$
and not on its twist~$E'$.
A supplementary layer of protection against these attacks
can be obtained if the twist~$E'$ satisfy
similar security conditions as the curve~$E$ itself.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the original curve and
its twist will never share the same exact behavior against
side-channel attacks, e.g. exactly one of the two curves the coefficient $b$
will be a square which is unoptimal against side channel attacks
as the curve will contain a special point of the form~$(0, y)$.
Moreover twist security won't protect against potential side channel attacks
where one would detect if the computation took place on the curve or its twist
and gain information on some bits of the secret.

Using a variant of the technique of Galbraith and McKee~\cite{lms2000gm},
we find that the probability that a random elliptic curve on~$\F_p$
is both secure and twist-secure
is bounded below by $\frac{0.2}{\log^2 p}$.
This probability means that
including twist-security in the conditions is particularly expensive,
since all necessary checks will be performed on
a quadratic (in $\log p$) number of elliptic curves.
In particular, in view of
the certificates mentioned in section~\ref{s:certif},
both the size and the cost of validation of the certificate
increase by a linear factor.
Although this property of twist-security is quite rare,
the curves satisfying it are not special
in the sense of section~\ref{ss:normal}.

\subsubsection{Special points}
\label{sss:special-points}

The \emph{special points} of an elliptic curve
are the points~$(x,y)$ such that one of the two coordinates is zero.
In the presence of such special points,
there exist side-channel attacks~\cite{pkc2003goubin}
exposing private information.

Several protections against these attacks exist~\cite{ches2004mmm}.
One of them is simply ensuring that the curve does not contain
any special point.

Special points of the form~$(x, 0)$ exist if the curve has
an even order.
Special points of the form~$(0, y)$ exist if the coefficient~$b$
is a square in~$k$.

\subsubsection{Special base field}
\label{sss:special-side}

Some common parameter choices,
such as the NIST elliptic curves~\cite{nist2000fips186-2},
use as their base field a prime field~$\F_p$
where $p$~is a prime number of a ``special form'',
such as a Mersenne, pseudo-Mersenne or generalized Mersenne numbers.
While the use of such prime numbers speeds up the modular arithmetic,
they are also more vulnerable to some side-channel attacks%
~\cite{ches2005dkj,ics2005ss,ches2014bpsy,eprint2014-434}.

\subsubsection{Unified group law}
\label{sss:unified}

Some curve families admit a \emph{unified} or \emph{complete}
addition law: these formulas have no exceptional cases
such as~$P + P$, $P + (-P)$ or~$P + 0$ for Weierstraß curves.
When using such formulas, a point multiplication
is computed in constant time relatively to the scalar,
which adds a layer of protection against side-channel attacks.

\subsection{Normality of the curve}
\label{ss:normal}

% Intro%<<<
The criteria we present here do not correspond to
known attacks on elliptic curves.
Rather, they are properties that random curves should verify
with overwhelming probability.
When generating curves, checking for these conditions
should reject a negligible proportion of curves.
If on the other hand a curve does not satisfy one of these conditions
then, even though we do not know any precise attack,
this curve is slightly more likely to be vulnerable.

More concretely this means that during the process of generating
a secure curve, in general, curves will be discarded
because they don't verify one of the criteria of Section~\ref{ss:dlp}.
When a curve passes the checks for the latter criteria,
the computations needed for the criteria of the current section
will be performed and will also pass with overwhelming probability.
Therefore, these computations will only be performed once in general,
on the final curve.
%>>>
\paragraph{Expected smoothness of random numbers.}%<<<

Many common number-theoretic computations depend on
the factorization of a parameter (for example, the order of some group),
and become easier when this parameter is smooth
(\emph{i.e.} when it has only small prime divisors).
We recall here~\cite{jnt1983cep} that the probability that
a number~$n$ be~$B$-smooth is approximately~$u^{-u}$,
where $u ≃ \log n / \log B$.

We must determine a threshold at which the factorization of these
numbers is considered ``too smooth''.
The first choice for a probability threshold would be
of the order of~$1/√p$, corresponding to the complexity of
the discrete logarithm in the group~$E(k)$.
% For example, for a fixed exponent~$α$,
% a number~$x ≈ p^{α}$ only has a probability~$≈ 1/√p$
% of being~$(\frac{\log p}{2\log\log p})^{2α}$-smooth.
However, numeric computations suggest that this choice may be too lenient:
for random numbers of 256~bits, the threshold probability of~$2^{-128}$
corresponds to numbers which are~$727$-smooth.
In a computational view, this bound is extremely low:
any algorithm involving polynomials or matrices of this size
would be easy to implement.
We instead use the smoothness bound~$B = p^{1/4}$,
corresponding to a probability of~$1/256$.
This means that we expect that $1/256$~of pseudo-random elliptic curves
will be rejected as ``too exceptional'',
while computations in these groups
are likely to involve linear or polynomial algebra
with size about~$p^{1/4}$,
which will likely remain out of reach for reasonable values of~$p$.

% We could instead balance the smoothness bound~$B = n^{1/u}$
% such that the probability of smoothness~$u^{-u}$ is~$1/B$.
% Using this estimate,
% we could say that
% a random number of $256$~bits should not be $2^{28}$-smooth
% and that a random number of $512$~bits should not be $2^{42}$-smooth.
% We think that more research is needed on this subject.
%>>>
\subsubsection{Discriminant of the endomorphism ring}
\label{sss:discriminant}

% If the number of points of~$E$ is prime,
% then its endomorphism ring is the maximal order~$\ro O_K$ of~$K$.
% preuve:
% sinon, il existe deux courbes isogènes ψ: E → E' ayant des anneaux
% d'endomorphismes distincts. Par conséquent, il existe un nombre premier
% ℓ≠N divisant f'/f (ou f/f' si on veut). L'isogénie ψ est donc
% (non_horizontale) sur le ℓ-volcan. Par conséquent, elle modifie la
% structure de groupe de E(k) ⊗ ℤ_ℓ, i.e. son noyau contient un groupe
% d'ordre ℓ. Or, puisque N est premier, E(k) ne contient aucun tel
% sous-groupe. ⚡


The \emph{endomorphism field} of the curve~$E$
is the field~$K$ generated by its Frobenius endomorphism~$φ$.
Since $φ$~is a root of the equation~$φ^2 - t φ + p = 0$,
$K$~is an imaginary quadratic number field.
The discriminant of~$φ$ is the value~$D_φ = t^2 - 4 p < 0$.
It is the discriminant of the order $\ro O_φ = ℤ[φ] \subset K$.
The discriminant of~$K$ is the (fundamental) discriminant~$D_K$ of its
maximal order $\ro O_K$.
It is the square-free part of $D_φ$: $D_φ = D_K f_φ^2$ for~$f_φ ∈ ℤ$
called the conductor of the order $\ro O_φ$.
The \emph{endomorphism ring} of the curve~$E$ is some order $\ro O_E$ in $K$:
$\ro O_φ \subset \ro O_E \subset \ro O_K$.
Let us denote its discriminant by $D_E$.
Note that if $E$ has prime order, then $\ro O_E = \ro O_K$.
More generally, if a prime $l$ divides the conductor $f_E$ of $\ro O_E$,
then it must divide the cardinality $N$ of $E$.

The expected value for~$D_E$ is~$D_K ≈ D_E ≈ D_φ$;
we know~\cite{jis2014cdkd} that the square-free part of
a random integer~$n$ is less than~$√n$
with probability approximately~$1.66/√n$.
For cryptographic sizes, this means that,
with overwhelming probability, we should expect~$D_K > √{D_φ}$.

The best method we know to compute~$D_K$ requires the
factorization of~$D_φ$.
For cryptographic values of~$D_φ$, this is a possible but
quite expensive task.
However, since almost all curves satisfy the condition~$D_K > √{D_φ}$,
this condition is extremely unlikely to lead to the rejection of a curve
and the computation will therefore be performed only once for the final curve
in practice.
Moreover, once the factorization of~$D_φ$ is known,
it is very easy to check again.

In particular, this approach eliminates
the two smallest discriminants~$D = -4$ and~$D = -3$,
corresponding to the special curves with $j$-invariant~$1728$ or~$0$.

\subsubsection{Class number and class group}
\label{sss:class-group}

The class number~$h(K)$ of the maximal order~$\ro O_K$
is the minimal degree of a number field
over which $E$~admits a faithful lift.
It is also the degree of the Hilbert class polynomial
used in the theory of complex multiplication.
Therefore, a large class number may prevent the use
of any attacks based on complex multiplication.
Under the generalized Riemann hypothesis,
the best method we know to compute the class number
is subexponential~\cite{chile2009biasse},
and requires at least a few days of computation for cryptographic sizes.
Since this method also computes the group stucture
of the ideal class group of~$\ro O_K$,
it can be used to produce a small and easily verifiable certificate
for the class number.
% It is related to the class number~$h(\ro O_K)$ of the maximal order
% by a simple formula~\cite[7.24]{cox1989primes}:
% if $R$~is the order of conductor~$f$, then
% $h(R) = h(\ro O_K) f ∏ (1 - \pa{\frac{D_K}{p}}/p)$
On the other hand,
the class number of~$K$ is minorated~\cite{cras1990louboutin},
under the generalized Riemann hypothesis,
by~$h(K) ≥ \frac{π}{3e} \frac{√{\abs{D_K}}}{\log \abs{D_K}}$.

\medbreak

The class number has a negligible probability
of being~$(\log p)^{1-o(1)}$-smooth.
While the best known algorithms for computing the class number
are sub-exponential~\cite{chile2009biasse},
for a polynomial bound~$B$,
it is possible to prove that $h$~is not $B$-smooth
in time~$O(B \log p)$, which is polynomial.
% it is possible to prove in polynomial time that $h$~is not $B$-smooth in polynomial time.
% Namely, for each prime~$ℓ < B$, let~$e(ℓ)$ be
% the smallest integer such that~$ℓ^{e(ℓ)} > h$;
% and define~$M$ as the product of all~$ℓ^{e(ℓ)}$.
% Since~$h = O(√p)$, we see that~$\log M ≈ \frac{B}{2 \log B} \log p$.
% If $h$~is $B$-smooth, then all elements of the class group~$\Cl K$
% have $M$-torsion.
% Therefore, any element~$g$ of the class group such that~$M g ≠ 0$
% proves that $h$~is not $B$-smooth.
% Since we expect that $\Cl K$~is almost cyclic,
% in general we need to check this for only one element~$g$.
% The number of multiplications required in~$\Cl K$
% is approximately~$\log M ≈ O(\log^2 p)$.


\subsubsection{Cardinality of the quadratic twist}
\label{sss:normal-twist}

The order of the quadratic twist of~$E$ is~$2(p+1) - N$.
This number lies in the same interval~$[p+1-2√p, p+1+2√p]$
as the curve order itself,
and therefore also as a probability about~$u^{-u}$
of being~$p^{1/u}$-smooth, for~$u > 0$;
for example, it has probability~$1/256$ of being~$p^{1/4}$-smooth.

We recall from paragraph~\ref{sss:twist} above
that the smoothness of this number has a direct influence
on the efficacy of some side-channel attacks.

Since the curve and its quadratic twist
share the same endomorphism ring,
they have the same discriminant.
Therefore, all properties already satisfied
by the discriminant of the curve are also satisfied by its twist.

\subsubsection{Special base field}
\label{sss:special-anormal}

In the case of the \emph{multiplicative} discrete logarithm problem,
the Special Number Field Sieve allows faster computations
of discrete logarithms modulo~$p$
when $p$~is a \emph{special} prime number,
\emph{i.e.} when it is a value of a polynomial of low degree
with small coefficients evaluated at a small value.

It is hard to check whether a given (prime) number is special.
However, most prime numbers used in standard elliptic curves
(for example in the FIPS 186--2 curves~\cite{nist2000fips186-2}
or in Curve25519~\cite{pkc2006bernstein})
are explictly given as special primes as these allow faster arithmetic
over the base field.
Even though we don't know any attack against curves with such special
parameters, it is legitimate to consider them as special.

A related question would be to detect curves whose number of points $N$
is a special number.
As noted above, this cannot be easily check.
Nonetheless, the only way we are aware of which could lead to the construction
of such a curve would be through the use of complex multiplication.
Therefore, the discriminant of the number field associated
to the generated curve would be unusually small and this would be detected by
other checks from this section.

\subsubsection{Embedding degree}

For any bound~$m$, the probability that
the embedding degree of~$E$ is at most~$m$
is~\cite{jc1998bk} $O(m^2 · p^{-1}·(\log p)^5·(\log\log p)^2)$.
This implies that, with probability~$1 - 1/√p$,
the embedding degree of~$E$ is at least~$p^{1/4 - o(1)}$.

\subsubsection{Multiplicative group of the base field}

The multiplicative structure of the base field~$\F_p^{×}$
is directly related to the factorization of~$p-1$.
In particular, if $p-1$~is smooth
(\emph{i.e.} all its prime divisors are small),
then the multiplicative discrete logarithm problem is easy.
Let~$B$ be a smoothness bound: then, with~$u = \log p / \log B$,
$(p-1)$~is $B$-smooth with probability~$≈ u^{-u}$~\cite{jnt1983cep}.
This means that, with overwhelming probability,
$(p-1)$~has at least one prime divisor greater than~$(\log p)^2$.

\subsection{Convenience of implementation}
\label{ss:convenience}

We list here a few criteria that
may make the implementation of an elliptic curve more convenient
without weakening the security.
In order to not weaken the ``normality'' of the curves,
we consider only these conditions which are satisfied
by an asymptotically non-zero proportion of all elliptic curves.

\subsubsection{Fast Jacobian coordinates}

Choosing a curve of the form~$y^2 = x^3 - 3 x + b$ (that is with $a=-3$)
enables to save 2 out of 10 multiplications~\cite{ieeep1363}
required to double a point in Jacobian coordinates.
A random elliptic curve over~$\F_p$
is isomorphic to a curve with~$a = -3$
with probability~$1/2$ if~$p ≡ 3 \pmod{4}$ and~$1/4$ if~$p ≡ 1 \pmod{4}$.

\subsubsection{Number of points at most~$p$}

If the number of points~$N$ is greater than~$p$,
then it might be impossible to represent numbers up to~$N-1$
in the same memory size as coordinates of points of~$E$.
Exactly one half of all curves satisfy this.

\subsubsection{Easy computation of square roots}

The \emph{point compression} method allows representing
one point~$(x,y)$ of~$E$ by only its abscissa~$x$ and
one bit discriminating between the two possible values~$±y$.
However, recovering~$y$ requires computing a square root in~$k$.
This is easier when~$p ≡ 3 \pmod{4}$ since
in this case, $c^{(p+1)/2}$~is a square root of~$c$ if $c$~is a square.

\subsubsection{Equations other than Weierstraß}
\label{sss:other-eq}

There exist several other representations of elliptic curves
than Weierstrass curves, such as
Edwards curves~\cite{ams2007edwards},
twisted Edwards curves~\cite{africa2008bbjl},
Jacobi curves~\cite{aaaaec2003bj},
and Montgomery curves~\cite{mathcomp1987montgomery}.
Only a finite proportion of curves are isomorphic
to a curve in these families.
For example, about~$35\%$ of all elliptic curves
are isomorphic to a twisted Edwards curve,
and about~$40\%$ are isomorphic to a Montgomery curve~\cite{sac2011plut}.

Each of these families requires at least
the presence of a point of order two on the curve.
This is a special point in the sense of~\ref{sss:special-points} above
and could introduce a weakness in some implementations.
The corresponding automorphisms also speed up the Pollard rho
method for discrete logarithms by a small factor~\cite{moc2000glv}.
Moreover, in the case of a non-prime base field,
there exist some attacks~\cite{jc2014fghr}
against several of these curve families
which somewhat weaken the discrete logarithm problem.

\subsubsection{Fast base field arithmetic}
\label{sss:special-fast}

The choice of a base field of a special form,
such as the field of integers modulo
a pseudo-Mersenne~\cite{pkc2006bernstein}
or generalized Mersenne prime~\cite{nist2000fips186-2},
allows the implementation of a faster, dedicated arithmetic.

\subsubsection{Special coefficients}

Most of the formulas for elliptic curve arithmetic
involve the use of the curve coefficients.
Choosing special values for these coefficients,
such as integers with a small absolute value,
allows a faster implementation.

\subsection{Families of curves with particular properties}
\label{ss:particular}

We give here a short list of families of curves
with particular properties which might be useful in some specific contexts.
These families are small enough
to contradict the ``normality'' conditions of section~\ref{ss:normal}.

\subsubsection{Curves with a fast endomorphism}

Some families of curves have an easily computable endomorphism.
This allows a faster implementation of point multiplication%
~\cite{crypto2001glv}, with a theoretical gain of up to 50\%.

However, the construction of these families
is done via the theory of complex multiplication~\cite{asia2013smith}.
This requires a small class group,
in contradiction with paragraph~\ref{sss:class-group}.

Moreover, in the presence of an endomorphism of order~$m$,
the Pollard rho method for computing discrete logarithms
becomes faster by a factor of up to~$√m$~\cite{asia1999dgm,moc2000glv}.

\subsubsection{Pairing-friendly curves}
\label{sss:pairing}

Some families of elliptic curves allow a fast pairing computation.
This construction has various applications in cryptography,
such as one-round three-way key exchange~\cite{jc2004joux},
short signatures~\cite{jc2004bls},
and identity-based cryptography~\cite{crypto2001bf,el2002paterson}.

The main requirement for the existence of a fast pairing
is that the embedding degree is small.
This is in direct contradiction with
the requirement from paragraph~\ref{sss:embedding-degree} above.

Moreover, most of the constructions
for pairing-friendly curves~\cite{jc2010fst,space2014em}
either use very sparse families of curves,
or use complex multiplication to construct adequate curves,
which requires a small class group,
in contradiction with paragraph~\ref{sss:class-group}.

\section{Transparent generation of curves}
\label{s:certif}

The selection of an elliptic curve for cryptographic purposes
involves checking a long list of properties,
including several for which arbitrary bounds have to be set:
such as the threshold at which we consider the class number
to be exceptionally small,
or the order of the twisted curve to be exceptionnally smooth.
This implies that the generated curve
will always depend from arbitrary choices,
including the choice of the sampling function for elliptic curves.

We give here the outlines of a certificate format
proving that a given curve was generated by a public algorithm
from a known seed.
This allows any program receiving elliptic curve parameters
for cryptographic purposes
to check, at a moderate computational cost,
that the curve is indeed suitable,
and moreover, that it is the first suitable curve
found by the sampling function.

\subsection{Generating an elliptic curve}

This procedure is in two steps.
First, a \emph{generating program} determines a suitable elliptic curve.
This programs outputs the elliptic curve
together with a \emph{certificate} proving that
the curve is actually suitable for cryptographic purposes.
Moreover, the certificate should also prove that
none of the curves previously tried by the generating program
was suitable.
Then, a \emph{validation program} can use the certificate data
to validate the generating process.
The certificate enables this second program
to have a significantly shorter runtime than the first one.

The list of conditions to be checked and the way to sample
curve parameters would be indicated in the certificate header.
We do not fully specify how every condition presented
in the previous sections should be written down in the
certificate when it leads to the rejection of a curve.
For most of the ones presented in Section~\ref{s:criteria},
checking whether a curve is suitable is very fast.
% XXX ?
However, two conditions in particular are more expensive:
namely, the condition that the curve order is prime
(this condition is expected to be the one condition
leading to rejection of all the unsuitable curves,
so that this check will be performed a large number of times),
and the computation of the class number
(which will typically be performed only once, for the final curve).

\subsection{Certifying the curve order}

The most restrictive condition in practice is that
the curve order must be prime, or a prime number
times a very small cofactor.
This means that we expect that a linear number (in $\log p$)
of curves will be rejected because of a composite group order,
whereas the first curve found with a prime group order
will be retained.

\subsubsection{Composite curve order}

Over a prime base field,
the most efficient methods to compute the curve order are
variants of the $ℓ$-adic SEA algorithm~\cite{mathcomp1985schoof,
jtnb1995schoof,smf2008cl}.
This algorithm computes the order~$N$ of the curve
by computing $N \pmod{ℓ}$ for several
auxiliary primes~$ℓ < O(\log p)$.
The fact that $N$~is composite may therefore be detected
either in an early step,
when there exists~$ℓ$ such that $N ≡ 0 \pmod{ℓ}$,
or at the end of the computation,
when we find that the computed value~$N$ is composite.

In the “early” case,
the counting algorithm finds a polynomial~$f$, of degree~$(ℓ-1)/2$,
whose roots are the abscissae of $ℓ$-torsion points of~$E$.
We may then recover one of these points by
computing one factor of~$f$ of degree~$1$:
using the Cantor-Zassenhaus polynomial factorization algorithm,
we find that the complexity of this operation
is approximately the same as that of computing~$N \pmod{ℓ}$,
so that computing this extra information
has a small impact on computation time.

\smallskip

In the other, “late” case, the curve order is not divisible
by any of the auxiliary primes.
The counting algorithm will then compute the exact value~$N$.
A simple pseudo-random proof of composition,
such as the Miller-Rabin test,
will then suffice to prove that $N$~is composite.
This case is less frequent than the “early” case;
it happens with probability
asymptotically equivalent to~$\frac{C}{\log \log p}$,
and in a few percents of cases for cryptographic sizes.
% calcul douteux -> 0.56/log log p, soit 11% pour 2^256.

\smallskip

In both cases, it is possible to produce a certificate of composition
of the curve order in the following form: $(N, G, Π)$,
where $N$~is a composite number,%a number such that~$N < 2 (√p - 1)^2$,
$Π$~is a proof of composition of~$N$,
and $G$~is a point of the curve such that~$N G = 0$.
Namely, in the “early” case, since we know a point~$G$ such that~$ℓ G = 0$,
we may output the certificate~$(2 ℓ, G, Π)$
where $Π$~is a certificate of composition of~$2 ℓ$.
In all cases, the full certificate has size~$O(\log p)$.
If $N ≡ 0 \pmod{ℓ}$, then the certificate of composition
is verifiable using~$O(\log ℓ) = O(\log \log p)$ operations in the base field;
else, $O(\log p)$~operations are needed.

We point out that if $G ≠ 0$ and~$n G = 0$, where
$N < 2 (√p-1)^2$~is composite,
then the curve order~$N$ is necessarily composite.
Namely, let~$d = \gcd(n, N)$. Since~$G ≠ 0$, we have~$d ≠ 1$.
If~$d = N$ then $N$~is a divisor of~$n$;
since $n/2$~exceeds the lower Hasse bound~$(√p-1)^2$,
we see that~$N = n$, and therefore $N$~is composite.
If on the other hand~$d ≠ N$, then $d$~is a strict divisor of~$N$.

\subsubsection{Prime curve order}
We expect that all non-prime curve orders
will be rejected by a pseudoprimality test such as the Miller-Rabin test.
Therefore, the generating program will have to run the primality proof
only once, for the last curve.

When the algorithm finds that the value~$N$ is prime,
a certificate is as follows: $(N, G, Π)$,
where $N$~is the number of points,
$G$~is a point of order~$N$ (for example, any random non-zero point),
and $Π$~is a proof of primality of~$N$
(which may be left empty if $p$~is small enough
that proving its primality directly is easier than using a certificate).
The validation program then checks that $G ≠ 0$,
$N · G = 0$, and~$N ≥ (√p+1)^2$.
If this is the case, then $N$~is the curve order.

For the sizes involved in elliptic curve cryptography,
proving the primality is practical using a test such as
the APR-CL test~\cite{fcs1980adleman,mathcomp1984cl}.
In the case where the validation program runs under strong contraints,
it is also possible to write a primality certificate
in a form such as ECPP~\cite{mathcomp1993am},
which has a reasonable size~($O(\log^2 p)$ bits)
and is verifiable in a short time~($O(\log^2 p)$ field operations).

\subsection{Fundamental discriminant and class group}

The fundamental discriminant is given by
the factorization of the discriminant~$D = t^2 - 4 p$.
While computing this factorization is quite expensive,
(and asymptotically dominates the whole generation process),
it will generally be performed only once, on the final curve,
and validating the factorization is extremely easy.

The knowledge of the fundamental discriminant gives a lower bound
on the class number of the endomorphism field of~$E$.
However, this bound is only approximately~$p^{1/4}/\log p$.

\smallskip

In some cases, a better (higher) lower bound~$B$ might be required.
We can prove that the class number is greater than~$B$
in the following simple way:
since the class group is expected to be almost cyclic~\cite{nt1984cl},
it is enough to produce an element~$g$ of order~$≥ B$.
However, checking this requires
computing the $B$ multiples~$g, 2g, …, B g$,
and is therefore exponential.

We do not expect to ever have to prove that a curve was rejected
because its class number is smaller than~$B$.
We know no efficient way to prove such a fact in general.
However, it might be enough to prove
that a few deterministically generated elements of the class group
all have order~$≤ B$:
while this does not prove that~$h ≤ B$,
it proves that the generating program was unable to prove that~$h > B$
and that the curve should therefore be rejected.

\smallskip

The same considerations apply to the smoothness of the class number.
If the class number is not smooth, then
verifying it is a quadratic computation.
If the class number is smooth, then
the generating program cannot prove it,
but it can prove that it was unable to prove that
the class number is not smooth.



% In this case as in the case of the curve order,
% there are potentially two cases to certify:
% namely, either that a curve was rejected because of a bad class group,
% or that the selected curve has a good class group.
% The first case is extremely unlikely to ever happen since
% most elliptic curves have a large class group.

\subsection{Choice of the sampling function}

The previous algorithms provide, to the best of our knowledge,
a certifiable way to transparently generate a cryptographic elliptic curve
from the input of some conditions and a sampling function.
In the case where the generating function is considered as pseudo-random
and the normality conditions of section~\ref{ss:normal} are included,
we feel confident that the resulting elliptic curve
will not have any particular weakness.
However, a malicious generating program, given enough computing resources,
might be able to run the generating algorithm
for a large family of seeds of a pseudo-random function
until a suitable elliptic curve is found.

Even though we think that a curve satisfying the normality conditions
of section~\ref{ss:normal} will generally be as good as possible
for cryptographic use,
a supplementary precaution against this manipulation
would be to put the seed choice out of reach of the generating entity.
Several examples come to mind.
For example, several entities could contribute to the seed,
each one of them generating its own secret share
and publicly committing it before all shares are revealed.
Another possibility is committing in advance to using
the result of some future observation expected to be out of reach,
such as the observation of sunspots,
a physical random number such as the result of a lottery drawing,
or a number derived from stock market or sports results.
